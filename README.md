Linear regression can be used for various purposes, such as:

Understanding the relationship between variables: It helps identify how changes in the independent variables relate to changes in the dependent variable.
Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the values of the dependent variable for new input data.
Estimation of coefficients: Linear regression provides estimates for the coefficients, allowing interpretation of their individual impact on the dependent variable.
Outlier detection: It can help identify observations that deviate significantly from the overall trend.
Extensions and variations of linear regression, such as multiple linear regression (with more than one independent variable), polynomial regression (including higher-order terms), and logistic regression (used for binary classification), exist to handle different types of relationships and data scenarios.
